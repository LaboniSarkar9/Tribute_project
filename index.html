                    <b>Kalpana Chawla </b>(March 17, 1962 â€“ February 1, 2003) was an Indian-American astronaut and the first woman of Indian origin in space. Her remarkable journey from a small town in Haryana, India, to becoming a NASA astronaut, and ultimately losing her life in the tragic Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, is an inspiring and poignant story.

Born in Karnal, Haryana, India, Kalpana Chawla displayed a passion for aviation from an early age. Despite facing societal expectations and gender norms, she pursued her dream relentlessly. After earning a degree in aeronautical engineering from Punjab Engineering College in India, she moved to the United States to further her education. She obtained a Master's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas and later earned a doctorate from the University of Colorado.
